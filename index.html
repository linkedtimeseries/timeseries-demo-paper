                        <p>The road to publishing public streaming data on the Web is paved with trade-offs that determine its viability. 
                            The cost of unrestricted query answering on top of data streams, may not be affordable for all data publishers. 
                            Therefore, public streams need to be funded in a sustainable fashion to remain online. In this paper we present 
                            an overview of possible query answering features for live time series in the form of multidimensional interfaces. 
                            For example, from a live parking availability data stream, pre-calculated time constrained statistical indicators 
                            or geographically classified data can be provided to clients on demand. Furthermore, we demonstrate the initial 
                            developments of a Linked Time Series server that supports such features through an extensible modular architecture. 
                            Benchmarking the costs associated to each of these features allows to weigh the trade-offs inherent to publishing 
                            live time series and establishes the foundations to create a decentralized and sustainable ecosystem for live data 
                            streams on the Web.

                        <p>The development of Internet of Things technologies has fostered the creation of live data streams in multiple domains. Specifically 
                            in the public domain, examples of such data streams can be found as sensor observations about air quality, noise level, 
                            street occupancy, vacant parking spaces, temperature, river water level, wind speed, state of public lighting systems, traffic lights, 
                            among others. Furthermore, in Europe thanks to the European Public Sector Information directive<sup><a class="footnote" href="#note-1">1</a></sup>, 
                            public authorities are required to publish such data in an open fashion on the Web. This raises new challenges for data publishers 
                            as they cannot anticipate the amount of users or type of queries required on the Web, and might not be able to afford expensive 
                            infrastructures, required to maintain availability and scalability.
                        </p>

                        <p>Studying the trade-offs introduced by Linked Data Fragments [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">1</a>] to publish data streams on the Web, 
                            helps to understand possible ways to reduce server costs by transferring query answering related tasks to clients. This requires 
                            clients to implement the logic to answer a given query, increasing their complexity and the time required to process the data on 
                            the client side. Anticipating this, data publishers may provide multidimensional interfaces [<a class="ref" href="#ref-2">2</a>] 
                            containing pre-processed data, relevant for answering common queries and offer them as a service that could benefit clients by 
                            reducing query
                        </p>

                            data and the related use-cases. Such an approach may help to create revenue sources for data publishers while contributing to the 
                            sustainability of the Open Data streams on the Web.
                        </p>

                        <p>In this demo paper we present an overview of possible multidimensional interfaces, containing query answering features, that may be 
                            implemented and offered as a service on different Open Stream data use cases. Furthermore, we introduce the initial developments of

                        <p>RDF Stream Processing (RSP) [<a class="ref" href="#ref-3">3</a>] defines a framework for continuous query answering over data streams. 
                            RSP engines can take into account one or more RDF streams to answer queries which results will be computed at several time instants 
                            to consider new available data on the streams. Triple Pattern Fragments Query Streamer (TPF-QS) [<a class="ref" href="#ref-4">4</a>] 
                            was introduced as an alternative to server-side RSP engines. with the goal of making RDF stream server-side publishing possible at a 
                            low cost, with a client-side RSP engine. In this approach, several time-annotation techniques were investigated, of which annotation 
                            using named graphs caused the least overhead. The results however showed that this approach has scalability issues when querying 
                            historic data.
                        </p>

                        <p>The work presented in [<a class="ref" href="#ref-5">5</a>] raises the fundamental question of the sustainability of the Web of data  
                            and introduces a marketplace for federated query answering, giving clients the option to decide from which sources do they want to  
                            retrieve the data needed to answer a certain query and who will process the data to obtain that answer. The cost of the answer(s) of 
                            a given query can be derived from the cost of hosting the related data. However determining what is the cost of computing such 
                            answer(s) is still an open issue. In this direction, benchmarking mechanisms could be used to determine it in terms of computational 
                            costs. For instance, the solution proposed in the HOBBIT project which provides a generic platform for benchmarking question/answering 
                            processes centered around the challenges of data heterogeneity and scalability could be used to determine the costs associated to 
                            answering a certain query.

                        <p>Multidimensional Interfaces [<a class="ref" href="#ref-2">2</a>] were introduced for generically fragmenting data with a specific order 
                            and publishing these fragments in an interface-level index. These interfaces can make multidimensional ordinal data automatically 
                            discoverable and consumable by clients using hypermedia controls. The goal of these interfaces is to raise the server expressivity 
                            while maintaining low server costs. A vocabulary<sup><a class="footnote" href="#note-2">2</a></sup> to formally describe multidimensional interfaces was 
                            introduced. It defines the concepts of <em>Range Fragments</em> and <em>Range Gates</em>. A <em>Range Fragment</em> is a Linked Data 
                            Fragment that specifies an ordinal interval for a predefined fragmentation strategy. A <em>Range Gate</em> is a Linked Data interface 
                            which exposes a set of Range Fragments. Using these concepts it is possible to define different fragmentation strategies that can be 
                            exposed as multidimensional interfaces.

                    <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                        <p>We introduced Live Time Series server which provides a Linked Data fragments based interface for publishing live time 
                            series on the Web. By integrating the concept of multidimensional interfaces data publishers can define modules that 
                            perform predefined calculations over the data that suit a given use case. This increases the expressivity of the server 
                            while keeping its costs low. It also reduces clients implementation complexity and data processing 
                            time to obtain a query answer. Allowing features to be turned off and on on the time series server, helps data owners to define what 
                            features they want to support and make the trade-off with their budget. Data reusers may still implement some of these features as a 
                            third party, yet then a revenue model should be thought of [<a class="ref" href="#ref-5">5</a>].
                        </p>

                        <p>In future work we plan to extend this approach by defining a mechanism that allows to calculate computational cost of multidimensional 
                            interfaces through benchmarking processes, in order to help determining their economical cost. Integrating mapping capabilities in order 
                            to work with non RDF data streams constitutes yet another future work line.</p>
